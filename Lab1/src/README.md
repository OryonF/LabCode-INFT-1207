# Secure Password Generator

### By: Jayce and Oryon

This program generates a secure password with
a user defined password length. In order to use
the program the user must enter the desired 
password length as a positive integer. If an 
integer is not entered the program will keep
prompting the user until the condition is met.
The user will then be prompted to enter the
desired amount of letters, then digits and
finally symbols they would like their password
to have. The user can enter any integer value
from the minimum value 0 to the maximum value
which is the password length and this will adjust
their maximum value going forward. For example
if the user chooses to use the maximum amount
on letters they will only be able to choose 0 for
digits and symbols. Also when it comes to the last
entered value symbols the minimum value will be
adjusted so the user will need to enter a value that
uses all the password length they have chosen.
For example if the total password length is 10
and 2 was chosen for the letter length and 3 was
chosen for the digit length the minimum value and
maximum value for the symbol length will become 5.
Once all values have been entered the program will
display the secure password with the users desired
settings.
